## Draft_Ner dataset
According to the definition of the Standardization Law of the People's Republic of China, standards refer to technical requirements that need to be unified in fields such as agriculture, industry, service industry, and social undertakings. Standards include national standards, industry standards, local standards, group standards, and enterprise standards.
However, standard knowledge has not formed structured information, and standard datasets are scarce.
Under the guidance of people, especially experts, we have constructed the first dataset for standard entity recognition, 
with a total of **1000 sentences**, including **7 relationship types**.

We have uploaded the model code to the cloud disk. Welcome to download and use it.
